NAME: ptime_align, to align and scale two profiles
AUTHOR: SHI DAI
VERSION: 1.0 3-MAR-2014
		 
INPUT: rname, fname, nchn, frac, rotate
	   rname: the name of data file, PSRFITS format, as the reference profile; fname will be aligned to rname; typically, this should be T,F scrunched profile
	   fname: the name of data file, PSRFITS format; you need to tell the program which sub-channel "nchn" will be aligned to rname  
	   nchn: the index of sub-channel, which will be aligned to rname
	   frac: fraction of off pulse 
	   rotate: fraction of pi to rotate profile

OUTPUT: 

To compile: sh run.sh (fftw3 and cfitsio needed)

Usage: ./ptime_align.out -r rname -f fname nchn -frac on off -rotate rot 
	    -r rname: the name of data file, PSRFITS format, as the reference profile; fname will be aligned to rname
		-f fname: data file, multiple files are not supported; 
	    -frac off: fraction of off pulse 
	    -rotate rot: fraction of pi to rotate profile
